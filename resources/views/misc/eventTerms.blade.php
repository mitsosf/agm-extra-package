        <p>In connection with the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Erasmus Student Network (ESN) to be held in Thessaloniki, Greece from the 18th till the 21th April 2019, I understand, accept and agree that:</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>The payment of the fee formalises the registration for the event and grants access to all the scheduled activities in the terms communicated in the application form and sent by e-mail.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="3">

Participants will pay the fee via credit/debit card (Visa, MasterCard or Maestro) using the payments system the OC provides. Additionally, a <strong>TWENTY EURO </strong>(<strong>20&euro;) deposit will be collected by the OC shortly before the check-in. The 20&euro; deposit is refundable, in case no damages were caused by the participant during the event. Participants will have to pay the deposit beforehand via credit/debit card (Visa, MasterCard or Maestro), using the Deposits payment system the OC may provide.</strong></li>
